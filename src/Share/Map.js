Offer them the Kaytee Nut & Fruit Blend to keep them fueled and happy. Pound for pound, nothing offers your feathered friend more energy than fruit and nuts. Provide a supply of All Living Things Nyjer Seed year-round as birds may abandon and not return to a feeding area if they find it empty. When offering more than one type of seed, place feeders at different heights to avoid conflicts between different types of birds. Always provide plenty of clean, fresh water.'
